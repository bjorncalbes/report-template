Yes, I can help you create additional pages based on the design of `page1.html`. However, I would need to know the specific design elements, structure, and content of `page1.html` to assist you effectively. 

Please provide the HTML code or describe the layout, styles, and any specific features you want to replicate in the additional pages. Additionally, let me know how many pages you need and any variations or unique content for each page.
