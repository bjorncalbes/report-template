Yes, I can help you create additional pages based on the design of `page1.html`. However, I would need to see the content and structure of `page1.html` to provide you with accurate and relevant code for the additional pages. 

Please share the HTML structure or describe the design elements you want to replicate, and let me know how many additional pages you need and any specific content or changes you'd like for each page.
