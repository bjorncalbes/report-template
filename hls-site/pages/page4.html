Yes, I can help you create additional pages based on the design of `page1.html`. To do this effectively, I would need to know the structure and content of `page1.html`, as well as any specific requirements or variations you want for the additional pages. 

Please provide the HTML code or a description of the design elements, and let me know how many additional pages you need and what content or changes you'd like for each one.
