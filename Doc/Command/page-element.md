Page Structure & Key Elements

Each page in the report follows a structured layout with several key components. The layout is designed to guide the viewer from a high-level summary to detailed insights and actions:

Header

Definition: A short title at the top of the page (usually 2–3 words) defining what the page is about.

Purpose: It immediately tells the viewer the subject of that page. The header acts as a quick context label.

Example: If a page is focusing on Google reviews, the header might simply be “Google Reviews.”

Hero Section

Role: The Hero Section is the executive summary of the page. After reading this section alone, the viewer should grasp the main message of the page. It highlights the core focus (the 1–3 key points) in a concise, impactful way.

Contents: A Hero Section typically includes the following elements:

Hero Badge: A short label for the broader theme or category of the page. (Example: Reputation Management & Geographic Expansion – indicating the general strategy or area the page is addressing.)

Hero Title: A one-line statement of the specific strategy, issue, or opportunity being discussed. This title should be punchy and descriptive. (Example: “Consistent reviews and strategic GBP expansion drive multi-market dominance.”)

Hero Subtitle: A brief subtitle (one or two sentences) explaining why this focus is important or what benefit it delivers. This should connect the strategy to the client's goals or outcomes. (Example: “Maintain momentum with policy-compliant review velocity while expanding your local presence to capture high-value markets. Each new location multiplies visibility and positions Hurwitz Law Group as a regional authority.”)

Hero Metrics: One to three key metrics that quantitatively underscore the page’s main point. These are headline stats that draw attention. For each Hero Metric, include:

Metric Label: A short descriptor for the metric (1–3 words, e.g. "Avg Rating", "New Reviews").

Metric Value: The numeric value or statistic (e.g. 4.8/5, +25%, 10 new reviews). Format it prominently since it’s a crucial piece of data.

Metric Note: A one-sentence note about why this metric matters or what its impact is. For example, a note might read "Surpasses industry average of 4.5, indicating excellent customer satisfaction." This provides context to the raw number.

Together, the Hero Badge, Title, Subtitle, and Metrics should give a coherent snapshot of the page's story—what we’re focusing on and why it matters, backed by a striking number or two.

Content Items (Page Sections)

Structure: Below the Hero Section, the page is divided into individual content items (or sections). Each item is a self-contained block that delves into a specific point or piece of evidence related to the page's theme.

Focus: Each content item should focus on one particular issue, strategy, advantage, or opportunity. For example, if the page is about online reviews, one item could focus on "Review Volume Trend", another on "Review Response Rate", etc.

Visual/Data Element: Every item must include at least one supporting visual or data element to illustrate the point. This could be:

A graph or chart (e.g. a line chart of review volume over time)

A table (e.g. a table of locations with their average ratings)

A statistic or KPI (displayed prominently in text or as an infographic)

An infographic or iconography that represents the concept

A screenshot from live data (e.g. a snippet from Google Analytics or a live dashboard)

A reference/citation from a trusted source or report (to add credibility)

Narrative Text: Alongside the visual, include a short explanation or insight. 1–3 sentences can clarify what the data shows and why it matters. Keep it concise and focused on insights, not raw data dumps.

Action Item Callout: Conclude each content item with an action item — a recommended next step or response to the insight. This should be placed in a highlighted call-out box or distinct text box within that item’s section. The action item must be short, specific, and achievable.

Example Action Item: After an item showing declining response rate to reviews, an action could be "Implement a weekly schedule to respond to all new reviews within 48 hours."

The call-out box should visually stand out (e.g., with a light background or border) so that the action is easily noticeable.

Separation: Design-wise, ensure each item is clearly separated from the next (through spacing, dividers, or distinct containers) so that the viewer can digest one point at a time.

Sidebar

Presence: Each page features a sidebar (likely on the left side or as a navigation panel). The sidebar remains consistent throughout the report.

Content: The sidebar can include navigation links or icons for each section/page of the report, a progress indicator, or branding elements, depending on the report’s needs. (For example, icons representing each page's topic can be listed vertically with labels.)

Consistency: All sidebar elements (background color, icon style, icon size, font size, font style, etc.) must be uniform across every page. If an icon and label are used for "Google Reviews" on one page, the same icon style and formatting should be used for other pages' icons/labels.

Design: The sidebar should be unobtrusive yet clear. Use subtle colors and simple icons that align with the minimalist theme. It should enhance navigation without drawing attention away from the main content.

Footer

Structure: The footer appears at the bottom of each page, separated from the main content by a divider line. It is not contained within the page’s main content div (allowing it to persist across pages – see persistence note below).

Content Areas: The footer contains a text area or section for notes on issues/concerns and a summary of action items for that page (or overall). This can be formatted as two columns or sections: one for "Issues/Concerns" and one for "Action Items", or a single consolidated notes area, based on design preference.

Usage: The footer serves as a running log or reminder area. During the presentation, the presenter or viewers can reference these notes, and potentially update them (if the presentation tool allows input) with new concerns or agreed-upon actions.

Persistence: The footer content should persist between pages. In other words, if you navigate to a new page in the report, the footer retains any text that was entered. This allows continuous tracking of issues and action items without resetting on each page. For example, if the client raises a concern on page 2 and it's noted in the footer, that note remains visible on page 3, page 4, etc. This is important for executive presentations so that important points are not lost as you move through the report.

Design: Keep the footer minimal in height so it doesn't dominate the page, but ensure the text is readable. A lighter background or a subtle shading can distinguish it from the main content. The divider line at the top of the footer area should be consistent across pages.
