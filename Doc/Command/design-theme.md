Design Theme & Aesthetics

Minimalist Style: Use a minimalist, clear, and concise design aesthetic (inspired by Apple's design ethos). This means plenty of white space, simple and clean layouts, and a focus on the content without unnecessary embellishments.

Clarity and Readability: Choose easy-to-read fonts and maintain consistency in font styles and sizes across the report. Headings, subheadings, and body text should be clearly distinguishable.

Professional Tone: Use a neutral color palette (unless specific data visualizations require distinct colors) to maintain a professional look. Since no additional branding guidelines are provided, stick to simple and modern visuals that would appeal to an executive audience.

Visual Consistency: Ensure consistent design elements across all pages – this includes color scheme, typography, iconography, and spacing. All icons should be uniform in style and size, and any effects or illustrations should follow a common theme.
