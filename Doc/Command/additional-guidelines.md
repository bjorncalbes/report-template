Additional Guidelines

Interactivity (Optional): Some pages might include interactive elements, especially for data tables or complex charts. For example, a table listing "Locations by Priority" or "Case Type by Priority" could allow sorting or filtering during the presentation to answer on-the-fly questions. Use interactivity only when it adds value to the discussion. All interactive components should still adhere to the overall style (consistent fonts, colors, etc.). If interactive elements are not supported in the presentation environment, ensure the default view of the data is insightful on its own.

Consistency Across Pages: Maintain a consistent layout structure page-to-page. While the content will differ, the audience should intuitively know where to find the header, hero info, content sections, etc., on every page. This consistency helps viewers focus on the insights rather than re-orienting to a new layout each time.

Executive-Friendly Content: Remember that the report is for executives. Use clear, jargon-free language (unless certain technical terms are well understood by the audience). Emphasize insights and actions over detailed methodology. The goal is to enable quick, informed decision-making.

Data Attribution: If using data from external sources or other reports, include a small reference in the item (for example, a source line under a chart or a footnote marker). This builds trust that the insights are grounded in reputable information. Ensure any such references are brief and unobtrusive, in line with the clean design.

Testing the Flow: When the pages are designed, rehearse the narrative flow. Each page’s hero section should seamlessly lead into its content items and then naturally segue to the next page via the sidebar navigation. The storyline from the first to last page should feel cohesive when presented in sequence.
