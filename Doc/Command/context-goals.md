Executive Report Design System Guide

Purpose: Outline the design, layout, and content structure for an executive-level presentation report. This guide ensures each page tells a compelling, data-driven story in a consistent, visually clear format.

Context and Goal

The goal of this project is to create a report for live presentation to a client. The presentation will be delivered by sharing the screen and walking through a series of designed pages. Key points about the report's purpose and audience:

Storytelling Focus: Each page should tell a specific story or narrative. Focus on 1–3 key points per page (e.g., critical issues, strategic advantages, opportunities, or recommended strategies).

Data-Driven Insights: All points must be supported by data. The report will demonstrate that every strategy, action item, opportunity, or issue is data-driven and impactful.

Executive Audience: The primary audience is executive-level stakeholders. Keep the content high-level and impactful, with additional details to be provided verbally by the presenter if needed.

Visual Evidence: Each page must include at least one visual or data element to support its narrative. Acceptable elements include graphs, tables, statistics, infographics, screenshots of live data, references from trusted sources, or data pulled from other reports or tracking sheets.

Keep it Concise: Avoid overcrowding pages with information. Each page should present key snapshots of information (enough to support the narrative) without going into exhaustive detail. Additional information can be used as talking points during the live presentation rather than on the page itself.
